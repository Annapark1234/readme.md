# The Effect of Covid-19 on Unemployment Rate in the United States

## Program Purpose
> The covid-19 outbreak caused various global problems, including rising unemployment. It significantly impacted young workers, women, workers with low educational attainment, part-time workers, and racial and ethnic minorities.
According to [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/11/unemployment-rose-higher-in-three-months-of-covid-19-than-it-did-in-two-years-of-the-great-recession/#:~:text=Unemployment%20rose%20higher%20in%20three,years%20of%20the%20Great%20Recession&text=The%20COVID%2D19%20outbreak%20and,20.5%20million%20in%20May%202020),
The outbreak of COVID-19 and the economic downturn it generated have raised the ranks of unemployed Americans by over 14 million, from 6.2 million in February to 20.5 million in May 2020. 

>The program's purpose is to analyze the overall rate of unemployment throughout the United States and compare each state's status 
with an average rate to check how many states have low and high rate since Covid-19 started.

> For accuracy, this program's data was collected from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/home.htm), a unit of the United States Department of Labor.
> As for the library, Pandas, Matplotlib, and BeautifulSoup, were used for the program. Each library was to manipulate tables and variables from data,
visualize the data frame, and pull data out of the HTML file. All libraries were used in Jupyter.

## Installation for Each Library:
* `pip install pandas`
* `pip3 install matplotlib`
* `pip install beautifulsoup4`

## Visualizing the unemployment rate between October 2019 and October 2020 
> To see the difference in rate after covid-19 outbreak, the chart that shows civilian unemployment rate was used for the program.
> Since the file was in HTML file, the data was converted into csv file by using BeautifulSoup.

```
import pandas as pd

import os

import sys

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

path = 'unemployment rate.html'

data = []

# Getting the header from HTML file

list_header = [] 
soup = BeautifulSoup(open(path),'html.parser') 
header = soup.find_all("table")[0].find("tr") 

for items in header: 
    try: 
        list_header.append(items.get_text()) 
    except: 
        continue
        
# Getting the data

HTML_data = soup.find_all("table")[0].find_all("tr")[1:]

for element in HTML_data: 
    sub_data = [] 
    for sub_element in element: 
        try: 
            sub_data.append(sub_element.get_text()) 
        except: 
            continue
    data.append(sub_data)
    
 # Storing data into Pandas
 
 dataFrame = pd.DataFrame(data = data, columns = list_header)
 
 # Converting Pandas DataFrame into csv file
 
 dataFrame.to_csv('unemploymentrate.csv.') 
 
 ```
 >Then to create the bar graph out of the chart, matplotlib was used:
 
 ```
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
 df.plot(x ='Month', y='Unemployment Rate', kind = 'bar')
 plt.show()
 
 ```
